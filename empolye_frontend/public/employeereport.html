                    <p>In order to keep track of their employees’ growth over a set period of time, companies and organizations would often request status reports, 
                        or simply reports, from their staff members. To provide employers with an overview of what has been completed as well as the team’s overall 
                        development throughout the course of a workweek, it is often delivered in the form of a brief series of working days, most commonly one week.
                         Employees will have the chance to reflect on their work and analyze how their contributions have benefitted the overall development of the assignment and the overall success of the team if they have this option to do so. 
                         Employers, on the other hand, can benefit from keeping track of their workers’ performance and growth in order to distribute work in an appropriate and effective manner when the situation calls for it.
